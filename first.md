## 🧾 Paragraph and Formatting Tags

Several tags are used to format content within paragraphs:

<p><b>Web browsers</b> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page <em>semantically</em> and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
